This sample app comes along with a neat tutorial to get started with the 
GData framework, but as of 10/26/10 the version of the framework is 1.10.0
and it doesn't contain the following methods that are called by the original
source of the app:
[GDataServiceGoogleYouTube fetchYouTubeFeedWithURL:delegate:didFinishSelector:didFailSelector:]
[GDataServiceGoogleYouTube fetchYouTubeQuery:delegate:didFinishSelector:didFailSelector:]

I looked at the GData source code and these methods are not defined there,
so I fixed that. Next exercise is to figure out what's wrong when you double-click
on a thumbnail.
